Quick and (very, very) nasty standalone version of Sage's pari/gp lib. All credit goes to them.

* Caution
Use this at your own risk. I don't have much clue what I did and why it works. 

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ python2 setup.py build_ext 
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from gen.pari_instance import pari 

In [1]: import gen

In [2]: a=pari("besselk(1,1)")

Out[3]: type(a)
Out[3]: gen.gen 

Out[4]: a
Out[4]: 0.601907230197235

# or 

In: a.besselk(1)
In: pari("4+%d" % 5 )


#+END_SRC

I have tested it only by launching ipython in the same dir as the builds output dir.

Tested with:
  - python 2.7.10
  - pari/gp : 2.7.4 (libpari-gmp-tls)

* Second warning
  - memory management (pari's stack and python's stack) should be a total mess.
